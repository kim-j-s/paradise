                                    earning the points, there shall be no wrongful accumulation. (However, if the employee of the premises or the leased spaces is a member, unless they have actually purchased goods or services, the resulting point accumulation
                                    shall be deemed wrongful.) <br>B. Wrongful use: Use another member’s points without such member’s consent. </li>

                            are justified, shall take measures so that they can continue to use regular membership service. </li>
                        <li>5. In the case of membership cancellation under Paragraph 1 above, the following shall apply.
