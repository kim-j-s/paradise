						Blackjack is one of the most popular casino table games. The object of the game is to beat the dealer's hand by having your cards total 21 or as near to 21 as possible without going over.
					</p>
					<p class="txt">
						According to the value of initial two cards drawn by the dealer and player, you may “Hit” for drawing an additional card or “Stay” to stop. If you feel unlikely to win the game, you may withdraw from the game by choosing the option of “Surrender” while giving up the half of your wager.
					</p>
					<p class="txt">
						If the dealer’s initial two card total less than 16, the dealer must continue to draw cards until he reaches 17 or greater. If the total values of the player’s hand or the dealer’s hand exceeds 21, they automatically lose the game and this is called a ‘Bust’.
					</p>
					<p class="txt">
						If the totaled value of the player’s hand exceeds 21, it is a bust and the game will be over. If the dealer is a bust, all players still remaining in the game automatically wins. At the completion of each game, all players who has higher value than the dealer’s hand will be paid. All players who has lesser value than the dealer’s hand will lose, and if there is a tie, the player’s wager will remain as it is
					</p>
					<p class="txt">
						If the initial two cards drawn by the dealer or player has an ace and a ten value card, the hand totals 21 and is called a “Blackjack”. When a player has a Blackjack, the player will be paid 3 to 2(1.5times) and cannot lose. However, if the dealer also has a Blackjack, it will be a “Push”.(tie)
